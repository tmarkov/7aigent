# Description

We want to create a plan for implementing the project. It should contain all necessary information to start work on the implementation, but not dig into specific implementation details.

# Plan

- [x] Discuss, decide, and document, the high-level architecture (independent of specific technologies).
- [x] Discuss, decide, and document the technologies we're going to use, and our coding style.
- [x] Update AGENTS.md file(s) with instructions for LLM agents working on the project.
- [x] Create a development environment
- [x] Create a directory structure.
