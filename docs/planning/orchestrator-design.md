# Description

Design the orchestrator, built-in environments (bash, python, editor), and the environment contract. This design should be use-case driven: start with concrete examples of what the built-in environments need to support, then determine how they should work, and finally derive the orchestrator architecture and environment contract that best accommodates them.

# Plan

- [ ] Identify concrete use cases for the bash environment
- [ ] Identify concrete use cases for the python environment
- [ ] Identify concrete use cases for the editor environment
- [ ] Design how each environment should work to support its use cases
- [ ] Define the environment contract (interface/protocol)
- [ ] Design the orchestrator architecture
- [ ] Document the complete design
